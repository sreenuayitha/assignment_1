In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. We have many different types of expressions in Python. \n",

Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "        eg:\n",

For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will return False. Studying logical expressions, we also come across some logical operators which can be seen in logical expressions most often."
